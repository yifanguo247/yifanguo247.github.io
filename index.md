# About Me

I am a Software Engineer living in Houston, TX. I work at Capital One where I'm part of the Global Finance team. To improve trading results, I use Python to create data transformation workflows, which help me analyze trading decisions and their performance.

I received a Bachelor of Science from Vanderbilt University where I studied Computer Science.

My current interests: quantitative finance, markets, machine learning, and mechanism design. I also like writing essays, driving across the US to stay in middle-of-nowhere AirBnbs, watching Olympic Swimming YouTube videos, learning Go (the game), and drinking light roast black coffee.

In JUne 2021, I published my first book Machine Learning. It is available on [LuLu Press](https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/yifan-guo/machine-learning/paperback/product-gz7jw6.html)!

I built this website using Jekyll. It's hosted on GitHub (free!).
